## Functions:
- Help functions: simulates mutations based on branch length
- Simulates DNA sequence based on a fixed population size. Made by everybody
- Simulates DNA sequence based on a variable (continuous) population size. Made by Camilla.
- Simulates DNA sequence based on a variable (bottleneck) population size. Made by Maiken.
- Various functions that provides different properties of the simulated data. For example: site frequency spectrum (SFS), visualization of ancestral tree, total number of mutations (S_total). Made by Elias.


## Classes
- Population with fixed size
- Population with variable (continuous) size
- Population with variable (bottleneck) size
