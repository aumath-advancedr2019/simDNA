\usage{
SNP(matrix(c(0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1),nrow=3))
}
\value{
The output of the function is a list.
The first element in the list is a vector containing the positions on which one or more mutations has occured.
The second element is the SNP matrix itself.
}
\description{
The function calculates the SNP matrix.
