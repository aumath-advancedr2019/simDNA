## Functions:
- simSeq: simulates mutations based on branch length. Made function together. Maiken and Camilla tests and write documentation.
- Simulates DNA sequence based on a fixed population size. Made by Camilla and Maiken
- Simulates DNA sequence based on a variable (continuous) population size. Made by Camilla and Maiken
- Simulates DNA sequence based on a variable (bottleneck) population size. Made by Camilla and Maiken
- Various functions that provides different properties of data. For example: site frequency spectrum (SFS), SNP matrix, total number of mutations (S_total), different ways of estimating mutation rate. Made by Elias.
- If time: visualization of ancestral tree. Made by everybody


## Classes
- Population with fixed size
- Population with variable (continuous) size
- Population with variable (bottleneck) size

Elias changes/specify print function for the different classes.

## Vignettes:

We make 2 vignettes. One for the functions that simulates data and one for the functions that analyzes data.
- Everybody is responsible for the vignette. Each person adds documentation for what they are working with. Elias creates the vignette.


## Variables:
Here we write what we call the different variables to ensure that they are consistent.

- SNP: the SNP matrix
- SFS: the site frequence spectrum
