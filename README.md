# simDNA
An R package for simulating DNA sequences.

## Overview
The purpose of this package is to simulate DNA sequences from different evolutionary models. In the first place from the standard coalescent with mutations, and as we learn more models in Asger's course, these will be added.
The functionality of the package is to simulate DNA sequences based on the input as well as information regarding the coalescent events and mutations. This could include when mutations/coalescent events occur, which sequences have coalesced, at which position along the sequence the mutation appeared, the SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) matrix etc.
